# Teleoperation-Driven and Keyframe-Based Generalizable Imitation Learning for Construction Robots

The construction industry faces challenges with low productivity and high injury rates. Robots can improve these issues by automating processes. However, teaching robots to perform complex tasks is difficult. We present a framework that uses human teleoperation data to train robots for repetitive construction tasks. First, we developed a teleoperation method and interface to control robots on construction sites. Second, we propose a method to extract keyframes from human operation data, reducing noise and redundancy in the training data. Third, we model the robot's visual observations of the working space to improve learning performance and reduce computational load. We validated our framework by teaching a robot to generate trajectories for excavation tasks using human operators' teleoperations. Results show that our method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating its potential for application.
